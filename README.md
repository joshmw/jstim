# jstim

This is my repo for experimental stuff I'm playing around with. Everything here is, by default, in beta. I'll push finished/usable code and stimuli to the gru or grustim repo (github.com/justingardner). 

If, for whatever reason, you have any questions, you can email me at joshmw@stanford.edu.
